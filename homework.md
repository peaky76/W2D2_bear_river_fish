# Bears, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A river should have a name e.g. "Amazon"
- A river should hold many fish
- A fish should have a name

- A bear should have a name e.g. "Yogi" and a type e.g. "Grizzly"
- A bear should have an empty stomach ( maybe an array )

- A bear should be able to take a fish from the river
- A river should lose a fish when a bear takes a fish

## Extensions

- A bear could have a roar method
- A bear could have a food_count method
- A river could have a fish_count method

# River
# Properties - name, fish_stock[]
# Methods - add_fish, remove_fish, fish_count

# Fish
# Properties - name

# Bear
# Properties - name, type, stomach_contents []
# Methods - roar, take_fish(river), fish_in_stomach
